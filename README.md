# Thinkful-Capstone2_Factors-driving-Home-Prices
This is a project to determine the factors driving house prices, which will help the team at an investment bank to understand how to allocate funds earmarked for investment into mortgage-backed securities. The data with 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential home, was used, to generate descriptive statistics. The correlation and regression analysis is done to figure the most impacting variables on house price and then hypothesis testing is performed on those to further emphasize the significance of their effect on the prices.
